## Pre-Game
You can find our Pre-Game presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tVFWQDNnd2UsO3T_kk8nUfYtH7osDYNN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114288661333988808015&rtpof=true&sd=true)


## First Sprint
In this first Sprint, our goal is to obtain a calculator that supports the basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and inverse sign.
In addition we want to have commands to manipulate the stack, in particular: Clear, Drop, Dup, Swap and Over operations.
In this phase is also included the design of a graphic user interface.

## Second Sprint
In this second Sprint, our goal is to increase the functionality of the calculator developed in the previous Sprint, allowing the user to perform calculations using 26 types of variables.
In particular, at the end of this Sprint, the calculator should allow to save the last value of the stack in a variable (operation >x), load a value associated with a variable in the stack (operation <x), increase the last value in the stack and add it to the value of a variable (operation +x) and decrease the value of a variable of the quantity present in the top of the stack (operation -x). Finally, the calculator should allow the user to define custom operations.

## Third Sprint

In this third Sprint, our goal is to increase the functionality of the calculator developed in the previous Sprint, allowing the user to execute the custom operations already defined, store the state of variables and restore it.
In particular, at the end of this Sprint, the calculator should allow to invoke a user defined operation and to execute all the operations in order, in addiction the calculator should allow to save a copy of all the 26 variables on a "variable stack" and restore for all variables the last values that were saved on the "variable stack" (removing them from that stack). Finally, the "save" operation can be performed several times, preserving several sets of variable values.
