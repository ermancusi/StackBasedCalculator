## First Sprint
In this first sprint, our goal is to obtain a calculator that supports the basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and inverse sign.
In addition we want to have commands to manipulate the stack, in particular: Clear, Drop, Dup, Swap and Over operations.
In this phase is also included the design of a graphic user interface.
